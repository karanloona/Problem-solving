	As a part of its competition, the school will conduct a codeathon, Lock the Code, where it has been given a value, and the participants have to decode it.
	The participants are given a value denoting the number of rows in the matrix; they need to print the pattern.

	Example : 
		For N=5, Pattern:
		E
		DE
		CDE
		BCDE
		ABCDE

	Among the participants, Ninja is new to programming and doesnâ€™t have much experience; he asks you to solve the problem. Can you help solve this problem?
