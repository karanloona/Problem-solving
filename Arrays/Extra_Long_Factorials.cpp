// The factorial of the integer n, written n!, is defined as:

// n!=n*n(n-1)*(n-2)*.......*3*2*1

// Calculate and print the factorial of a given integer.

// For example, if n=30, we calculate  and get 265252859812191058636308480000000.

// Function Description

// Complete the extraLongFactorials function in the editor below. It should print the result and return.

// extraLongFactorials has the following parameter(s):

// n: an integer
// Note: Factorials of  can't be stored even in a  long long variable. Big integers must be used for such calculations. Languages like Java, Python, Ruby etc. can handle big integers, but we need to write additional code in C/C++ to handle huge values.

// We recommend solving this challenge using BigIntegers.
